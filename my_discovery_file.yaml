# This section is required for an 'eos-bios' launch.
launch_data:
  # --- WHEN ---
  # The Ethereum block is the seed data we're waiting to launch the
  # 'orchestrate' step.  When you start 'eos-bios orchestrate', it
  # first fetches the Ethereum block's hash, and uses it for
  # randomly selected the BIOS Boot node.
  launch_ethereum_block: 5544732  # Past block, for testing
  #launch_ethereum_block: 5716358  # Approx June 2st 2018, 0100 UTC, 2 hours after snapshot freeze

  # --- WITH WHO ---
  #
  # Other BPs' discovery_link, with whom you're comfortable launching
  # the network with, you've discussed and think they are competent to
  # 1) not screw up a launch and, 2) run the network and take good
  # decisions.
  #
  # By tagging along peers, we are effectively creating a
  # distributed graph. 'eos-bios' will be able to traverse this graph
  # and create a full portrait of the community, with all information
  # necessary to automate the steps of network boot.
